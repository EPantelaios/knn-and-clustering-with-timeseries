# Project2

Part A)

Nearest neighbor search of a timeseries represented as a polygonal curve with the following techniques:
i)    In Euclidean space R^d with Euclidean distance metric
ii)   In Euclidean space R^2 with Discrete Frechet distance metric
iii)  In Euclidean space R with the Continuous Frechet distance metric



Part B)

Clustering of timeseries using the following techniques:

Initialize centroids with technique:
i) K-means++

Assignment with:
i)    Lloyd's approach
ii)   Reverse range search with LSH Frechet
iii)  Reverse range search with LSH Vector
iv)   Reverse range search with Hypercube

Update centroids calculating the average timeseries as:
i) Vector
ii) Curve
