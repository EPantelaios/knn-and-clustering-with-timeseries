# Project2

Part A)

Searching for the nearest neighbor of a timeseries represented as a polygonal curve with the following techniques:
i)    In Euclidean space R^d with metric Euclidean distance
ii)   In the Euclidean space R^2 with metric Discrete Frechet distance
iii)  In the Euclidean plane X with metric the Continuous Frechet distance



Part B)

Clustering of timeseries using the following techniques:

Initialize centroids with technique:
i) K-means++

Assignment with:
i)    Lloyd's
ii)   Reverse range search (LSH Frechet)
iii)  Reverse range search (LSH Vector)
iv)   Reverse range search (Hypercube)

Update centroids calculating the average timeseries as:
i) Vector
ii) Curve
